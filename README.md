# Straight-Line-Simulation-
Quasi-steady state straight line acceleration simulation for PER26 vehicle. 

Tutorial: 

run gui 

Select config (rwd) or (awd)  

input low gear ratio and high gear ratio for sweep. if you want to look at specific gear ratio just put same number for both 

input vehicle mass 

Use case: gear ratio selection, power output calculation 

Validation with PER25 accel results ongoing..
