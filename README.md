# Straight-Line-Simulation-
Quasi-steady state straight line acceleration simulation for PER26 vehicle. 

Tutorial: 

RWD mode & 4WD mode (if you want to run RWD, set rear_bias to 1.0, if you want to run 4WD , set rear_bias to 0) 

Gear ratio (if you want to do a sweep, change gr_low to lower bound, and gr_high to upper bound) 

Examine graphs (if you want to look closely at graphs for a specific gear ratio, set gr_low and gr_high to the same number) 


Use case: gear ratio selection, power output calculation 

Validation with PER25 accel results ongoing..
